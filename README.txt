Hello,

This is a simple android app (first I ever made). I made it as a gift for a friend,
so I had to remove all of the personal content, 
and replace it with some cat images and unimportant messages.
Also, I've cut a majority od cases (in switch and case), just to show how I did it, 
but without a need to make up a hundred texts (default ones will be shown in cases 6-110).

Big imagebutton in the main activity used to show random text message, 
cookie button leads to activity where all of them are accessible.
